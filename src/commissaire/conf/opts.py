This is the single point of entry to generate the sample configuration
file for Commissaire. It collects all the necessary info from the other modules
in this package. It is assumed that:

* every other module in this package has a 'list_opts' function which
  return a dict where
  * the keys are strings which are the group names
  * the value of each key is a list of config options for that group
* the commissaire.conf package doesn't have further packages with config options
* this module is only used in the context of sample file generation
